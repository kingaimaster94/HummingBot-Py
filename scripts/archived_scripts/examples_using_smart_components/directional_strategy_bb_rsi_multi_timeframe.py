class MultiTimeframeBBRSI(DirectionalStrategyBase):
    """
    MultiTimeframeBBRSI strategy implementation based on the DirectionalStrategyBase.

    This strategy combines multiple timeframes of Bollinger Bands (BB) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicators to
    generate trading signals and execute trades based on the composed signal value. It defines the specific parameters
    and configurations for the MultiTimeframeBBRSI strategy.

    Parameters:
        directional_strategy_name (str): The name of the strategy.
        trading_pair (str): The trading pair to be traded.
        exchange (str): The exchange to be used for trading.
        order_amount_usd (Decimal): The amount of the order in USD.
        leverage (int): The leverage to be used for trading.

    Position Parameters:
        stop_loss (float): The stop-loss percentage for the position.
        take_profit (float): The take-profit percentage for the position.
        time_limit (int or None): The time limit for the position in seconds. Set to `None` for no time limit.
        trailing_stop_activation_delta (float): The activation delta for the trailing stop.
        trailing_stop_trailing_delta (float): The trailing delta for the trailing stop.

    Candlestick Configuration:
        candles (List[CandlesBase]): The list of candlesticks used for generating signals.

    Markets:
        A dictionary specifying the markets and trading pairs for the strategy.

    Inherits from:
        DirectionalStrategyBase: Base class for creating directional strategies using the PositionExecutor.
