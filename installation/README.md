# Installation

Formerly, this folder contains automated scripts for installing Hummingbot via Docker and from source. It has now been deprecated in favor of newer, updated instructions.

### Via Docker

Visit the [Deploy Examples](https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy-examples) repo for instructions for deploying Hummingbot in various configurations with Docker.

### From Source

For advanced users and developers who would like to access and modify the Hummingbot program files, installation from source is preferred. 

Visit the [Installation](https://docs.hummingbot.io/installation/) section in the Hummingbot docs for platform-specific guides.
